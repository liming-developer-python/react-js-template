## How to run
I mean, you kinda have to run the app **AT LEAST** 10 times.

1. Open a terminal
2. Run `yarn install`. If you don't have Yarn installed, run `npm install yarn` then `yarn install`.
3. Run `yarn start`. This will start the web server.
4. Open `index.html` once it's finished compiling.
